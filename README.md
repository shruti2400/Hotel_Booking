**Project Overview:**  
This project investigates the high cancellation rates experienced by City Hotel and Resort Hotel, aiming to identify the factors contributing to cancellations and provide actionable business solutions to improve revenue. Through data analysis, we focus on key aspects such as pricing, booking behavior, and seasonal trends.

**Key Objectives:**  
- Identify the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations.
- Provide recommendations to reduce cancellations and enhance revenue.
- Assist hotels in making informed pricing and promotional decisions.

**Assumptions:**  
- The data used is from the years 2015-2017 and does not include any major anomalies.
- The information is up-to-date for analyzing the hotelâ€™s future plans.
- There are no unexpected drawbacks for the hotels adopting the recommended strategies.
- The hotels are not using any of the suggested solutions yet.

**Research Questions:**  
1. What factors contribute to hotel reservation cancellations?  
2. How can cancellations be reduced?  
3. How can hotels optimize pricing and promotional strategies?

**Hypotheses:**  
1. Higher prices lead to more cancellations.  
2. Longer waiting lists increase cancellation rates.  
3. Most clients book through offline travel agents rather than online platforms.

**Analysis & Findings:**  
- **Cancellations vs. Confirmed Reservations:** 37% of bookings were canceled, significantly affecting hotel earnings.
- **Price Sensitivity:** Cancellations tend to be higher when prices are higher, with resort hotels more affected on weekends and holidays due to higher rates.
- **Seasonal Trends:** August has the highest number of confirmed and canceled bookings, while January sees the most cancellations, suggesting a seasonal pattern.
- **Portugal's Impact:** Portugal has the highest number of cancellations, contributing significantly to the overall trends.

**Recommendations:**  
- **Pricing Strategy:** Lower prices for specific locations and offer discounts to reduce cancellations.  
- **Weekend/Seasonal Discounts:** Resort hotels should offer discounts on weekends and holidays to encourage bookings.  
- **Marketing Campaigns:** Target marketing efforts in January, the month with the highest cancellations, to boost bookings and revenue.  
- **Quality Improvements:** Enhance services, particularly in Portugal, to reduce cancellations.

**Conclusion:**  
The project highlights the factors contributing to high cancellation rates in hotel bookings and provides actionable recommendations to reduce cancellations, improve pricing strategies, and optimize hotel operations to boost revenue.
