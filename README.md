**Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis**

## Project Overview  
This project explores the high cancellation rates at City Hotel and Resort Hotel. By identifying the factors causing cancellations, we aim to provide solutions that can help improve revenue and optimize hotel operations. Through detailed data analysis, we examine elements such as pricing strategies, customer booking behaviors, and seasonal patterns.

## Key Objectives  
- Understand the key factors influencing hotel reservation cancellations.
- Offer strategies to reduce cancellations and boost hotel revenue.
- Provide insights to help hotels make more informed pricing and marketing decisions.

## Assumptions  
- The data used is from the years 2015 to 2017, without any significant anomalies.
- The information is relevant and up-to-date for analyzing the hotels' future strategies.
- There are no unforeseen issues with implementing the suggested recommendations.
- The hotels are currently not using any of the proposed solutions.

## Research Questions  
1. What factors are most responsible for hotel reservation cancellations?  
2. How can cancellations be reduced effectively?  
3. How can hotels adjust their pricing and marketing strategies to optimize bookings?

## Hypotheses  
- **Higher prices lead to more cancellations.** Customers are more likely to cancel when room rates are higher.  
- **Longer waiting lists result in more cancellations.** Waiting for confirmation might increase cancellation rates.  
- **Most customers use offline travel agents.** Offline travel agents may be the primary booking source, rather than online platforms.

## Analysis & Findings  

### Cancellations vs. Confirmed Reservations  
Our analysis reveals that 37% of hotel bookings were canceled, which significantly impacts hotel revenues. This is a concerning figure that points to room vacancies and missed income.

### Price Sensitivity  
Cancellations are higher when hotel prices are steep, and resort hotels see a sharper rise in cancellations, especially on weekends and holidays. The data shows that pricing plays a major role in whether guests decide to cancel their reservations.

### Seasonal Trends  
August shows the highest number of both confirmed and canceled reservations, indicating it is a peak month for bookings. On the other hand, January experiences the highest cancellation rate, possibly due to seasonal factors, highlighting the need for targeted strategies during slower months.

### Portugalâ€™s Impact  
Portugal stands out with the highest cancellation rate, contributing a significant share to overall trends. This insight suggests that localized efforts could be particularly beneficial in this region.

## Recommendations  
- **Pricing Strategy:** Adjust rates for specific locations to make them more competitive and offer discounts to reduce cancellations.  
- **Weekend/Seasonal Discounts:** Resort hotels should offer discounts during weekends and holidays to incentivize guests to book and reduce cancellations.  
- **Marketing Campaigns:** In January, a month with high cancellations, hotels should consider running targeted marketing campaigns to boost bookings.  
- **Quality Improvements:** Improving the quality of services, especially in Portugal, could help decrease cancellations and improve customer satisfaction.

## Conclusion  
This analysis has shed light on the various factors influencing hotel booking cancellations. By adopting better pricing strategies, offering discounts, and improving service quality, hotels can significantly reduce cancellations, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately improve their revenue.
